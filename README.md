In this repository, i uploaded in the master section some codes that I worked on for studying.
The codes are all in Java, and they were used as exemples to putting in practice some concepts about framework utilizing Java language.
These codes were made during the professor Emerson Rodolfo AbrahamÂ´s class in FIAP.
